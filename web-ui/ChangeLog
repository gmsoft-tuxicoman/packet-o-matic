WEBUI: Moved set password into its own dialog box
WEBUI: Fixed set password so it actually works again
WEBUI: Removed waiting for serial check to come back okay before firing other onloads
WEBUI: Added a network retry / backlog support so on a network error it pauses gracefully
WEBUI: Only refresh the logs when the serial changes not every second
WEBUI: Moved all the action buttons to the top of the interface similar to the website
