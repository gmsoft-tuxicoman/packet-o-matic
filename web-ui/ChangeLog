Moved set password into its own dialog box.
Fixed set password so it actually works again.
Removed waiting for serial check to come back okay before firing other onloads.
Added a network retry / backlog support so on a network error it pauses gracefully.
Only refresh the logs when the serial changes not every second.
Moved all the action buttons to the top of the interface similar to the website.
