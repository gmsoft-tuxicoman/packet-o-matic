What it is :
------------
Packet-o-matic is a modular network sniffer and packet processor. The modules consists of input, match, conntrack, helper and target.
It is designed to be as protocol independant as possible. Each protocol has it's own module for match, conntrack and helper (if applicable).


Building from svn :
-------------------
You need at least autconf-2.61. First run autoreconf to create ./configure and then follow the instructions as if you fetched from a tarball.


Building from tarball :
-----------------------
Run these commands in order :
./configure
make
make install


Running it :
------------
If you make install, you are fine. The program will be able to find the libraries using automatic resolving or hardcoded library path.
If you did not run make install, you have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/libdir. By default, libtool creates the libs into the src/.libs directory.

Some modules such as input_pcap requires root privileges in order to perform their operation.


Dependencies :
--------------
 - libpcap : optional to build input_pcap and target_pcap
 - libxml2 : mandatory to parse the configuration


How it works :
--------------
Packets are read from the input.
We check against each match of each rule if we should make that packet processed by the targets of the rule.
At the same time we check if a helper is needed and for example put all the ipv4 fragments into a single packet.
We check if the packet has some conntrack information attached to it.
If the packet has conntrack info, it is processed by the coresponding targets which saved the conntrack info.
It the match result is positive, we process the packet with the targets defined for this rule.


The config :
------------
The config is written in XML. The default config file is named pom.xml.conf.
Everything is enclosed in the <config> tags. Then it consists of one <input> section and one or multiple <rule> section.
The input section defines from where you want to read the packets. You certainly want the pcap input to read from an ethernet interface.

Each rule contains one or more <target> section and one or more <match> section.
See pom.xml.conf.example for an example. See `packet-o-matic -h` for parameter lists for each module.


The inputs :
------------
The input modules read packet from a certain source and give the packets to the rule processor.

- pcap : allow you to read from one or all network device or from a pcap file saved by tcpdump or ethereal for example
- docsis : allow you to read fron a docsis stream using a dvb-c card and the linux-dvb api


The matchs :
------------
The match modules are used to specify the network traffic that you want to match and pass to the targets.

IMPORTANT : You'll have to specify the full header chain to match a packet. For example to match tcp traffic (on IPv4), you have to match in order ethernet, ipv4, tcp.

- docsis : match the docsis protocol
- ethernet : match the ethernet protocol
- linux_cooked : match linux cooked protocol used by pcap
- ipv4 : match the IPv4 protocol commonly known as ip
- ipv6 : match the IPv6 protocol
- tcp : match the TCP protocol
- udp : match the UDP protocol
- rtp : match the RTP protocol used to carry real time voice and video
- undefined : used internaly. do not use in your config !


The targets :
-------------
The target modules process the packet and most of the time, saves it or resend it.

- display : display usefull information about the packets being matched
- dump_payload : saves the payload of the last matching protocol into a file
- inject : reinject the matched packets on an specific interface
- pcap : save the packets in a pcap file
- tap : open a tap interface and send the packets trough it
- tcpkill : works only with tcp packets. Send a TCP RST packet to any matched tcp packet
- wave : save RTP payload into .au files. Supported payload types are G.711U, G711A and G.722
- null : does nothing, used for debugging or as a template


The conntracks :
----------------
The conntrack modules make the application able to recognize different connections among all the packets that it process.
It makes it easy to follow a connection and do something specific with that connection or save some information related to that connection.
The conntrack modules are automatically loaded if found, when the corresponding match is loaded.


The helpers :
-------------
The helper modules are used to recompose part of network packets which were splitted or modified by the network.
The only helper module currently implemented is ipv4. TODO : ipv6, tcp.
