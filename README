What it is :
------------
Packet-o-matic is a modular network sniffer and processor. The modules consists of input, match, conntrack, helper and target.
It is designed to be as protocol independant as possible. Each protocol has it's own module of match, conntrack and helper if is makes sens or if it is implemented.


The config :
------------
The config is written in XML.
Everything is enclosed in the <config> tags. Then it consists of one <input> section and one or multiple <rule> section.
The input section defines from where you want to read the packets. You certainly want the pcap input to read from an ethernet interface.

Each rule contains one <target> section and one or multiple <match> section.
See pom.xml.conf.example for an example. See `packet-o-matic --help` for parameter lists for each module.


How it works :
--------------
Packets are read from the input.
We check against each match of each rule if we should make that packet processed by that target.
At the same time we check if a helper is needed and for example put all the ipv4 fragments into a single packet.
We check if the packet has some conntrack information attached to it.
If the packet has conntrack info, it is processed by the coresponding target which saved the conntrack info.
It the match result is positive, we process the packet with the target.
